# Running a controlled `call` corruption on Sancus

Run the evaluation with `./run-sancus-eval.sh`.
This will produce two simulation outputs, the first one runs on the unchanged Sancus core, which will result in a memory violation (stopping the attack).
The second one runs after disabling the PC buffering, showing a successful overwrite of enclave values.
