Nemesis: measure execution time of individual instructions through interrupt delays.

After launching the debug session, do a hard reset (to activate IPE), then run the code.

Expected output:
----------------
Latency: 1 cycles, next PC: 480c
Latency: 3 cycles, next PC: 4810
Latency: 5 cycles, next PC: 4816
Latency: 3 cycles, next PC: 1de4
